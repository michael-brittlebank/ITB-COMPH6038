/*

You need to create a class BookQueries that establishes connection to the bookshop database, and uses 4 prepared statements:
one for selecting all books from the book table (your query should not include bookId);
one for updating the price of a book given its name;
one for inserting a book;
and one for deleting a book given its name.
The statements should be initialised using appropriate sql queries. For each of the 4 operations, you should have appropriate methods that return appropriate values, using appropriate execute methods;
